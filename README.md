# Testcontainers with Spring boot demo

This is a demo project to show the easiest way to
use testcontainers library with Spring Boot.

It's not the best way and it's not the right way,
it's just the easiest in my opinion.

Container is started by singleton class com.evilcorp.demo.StaticOracleContainer .

It is connected to Spiring by com.evilcorp.demo.TestcontainersInitializer
